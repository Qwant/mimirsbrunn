This directory contains a set of interesting geojson files intended to
cover a wide breadth of parsing behaviors.

Those in the `canonical` directory represent valid canonical geojson
files, meaning they can be parsed and rewritten without losing any data.

Some of the test geojson files were lifted from MapBox's geojsonhint project (ISC LICENSE)
